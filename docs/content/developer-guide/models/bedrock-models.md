Before using the models, you will need to request access to specific models via Amazon Bedrock.

To request access to additional models, select the **Model access** link from the left side navigation panel in the Amazon Bedrock console. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Bedrock Model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) user guide.
