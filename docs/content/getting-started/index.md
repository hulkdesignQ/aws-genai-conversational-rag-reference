# Quickstart

## What's in this guide?

Galileo is a framework to help you rapidly experiment with, deploy, and launch Generative AI powered products and services on the AWS platform. This guide describes how to install and configure the Galileo Generative AI Reference Sample.

After deployment, you can access all of these components:

- A pre-built conversational UI that enables contextual conversation with memory,
- An optimized embeddings vector store based on RDS Postgres and `pgvector`,
- A scalable and elastic data ingestion pipeline,
- A low latency text embeddings inference engine,
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) features, and
- A choice of open source large language models.

(Optional) You can deploy Galileo with a sample dataset of US Supreme Court decision documents, providing content users can interact with immediately.
